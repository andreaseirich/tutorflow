# Git: English Only + Commit & Push After Every Change

**Rules when working on this repository:**
1. Commit messages must always be written in **English**
2. Use conventional commit format: `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, etc.
3. **After every change:** Commit and push. Do not leave uncommitted changes.

Examples:
- ✅ `fix: disable Django Admin, add 404 test`
- ✅ `feat: add multi-tenancy - separate data per user`
- ❌ German commit messages
