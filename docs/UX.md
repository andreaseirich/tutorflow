# UX Notes

- Added ARIA labels to key buttons (create lesson, edit lesson, view conflicts) to improve accessibility and Lighthouse scores.
- Calendar interactions are click-to-create (no drag), with status colors for clarity (planned/paid/conflict).
- Further Lighthouse improvements: ensure HTTPS in production, set proper meta viewport (already present in base template), and serve optimized static assets via collectstatic.
