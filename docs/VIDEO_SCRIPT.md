# TutorFlow – 90-Second Demo Video Script

## Structure (90 seconds total)

### 1. Problem (20 seconds)

**Visual**: Show a messy calendar, scattered notes, or a spreadsheet.

**Script:**
"Private tutors juggle multiple challenges: scheduling lessons across different students and contracts, avoiding double bookings, tracking income, and preparing quality lesson plans. Most tools solve one problem — calendars for time, spreadsheets for billing, separate apps for planning. Tutors waste 2–3 hours per week on administrative overhead."

**Transition**: "TutorFlow integrates all of this into one system."

---

### 2. Solution (40 seconds)

**Visual Flow**:

1. **Calendar & Conflicts (15s)**
   - Open week view: "Here's the central calendar — click any time block to create a lesson."
   - Show conflict detection: "The system automatically detects conflicts: time overlaps, blocked personal time, and contract quota violations."
   - Click conflict icon: "See the detailed conflict information — prevents double bookings before they happen."

2. **Billing & Invoices (10s)**
   - Navigate to invoices: "Once lessons are taught, generate invoices automatically."
   - Create invoice: "Select a period, and the system calculates everything — no manual entry."
   - Show income overview: "Track planned vs. actual income with clear monthly comparisons."

3. **AI Lesson Planning (15s)**
   - Open lesson detail: "For premium users, AI-assisted lesson planning."
   - Click "Generate AI Lesson Plan": "The system uses sanitized context — no personal data leaves the system — and generates structured lesson plans instantly."
   - Show mock notice: "In demo mode, responses are mocked for instant testing without external APIs."

**Script:**
"TutorFlow combines intelligent scheduling, automatic conflict detection, billing automation, and AI lesson planning — all in one workflow designed specifically for tutors."

---

### 3. Why It's Unique (15 seconds)

**Visual**: Show the integrated workflow diagrammatically or highlight the unified interface.

**Script:**
"TutorFlow isn't another generic calendar. It's a purpose-built operating system for tutors that uniquely combines contract-based quotas, conflict detection, invoicing, and AI planning in one coherent system. Most tools solve one problem — TutorFlow integrates all of them."

---

### 4. Tech Credibility (15 seconds)

**Visual**: Show code structure, service layers, or CI badge.

**Script:**
"Built with Django 6.0 and clean architecture: service layers for conflict detection and billing, deterministic demo design with mock LLM for instant testing, production-ready practices like transaction-safe billing and environment-based configuration. The codebase demonstrates engineering maturity, not just tool usage."

**Closing**: "TutorFlow — all-in-one tutoring operations, built for real workflows."

## Key Points to Emphasize

- **Uniqueness**: Domain-specific, not generic
- **Real Impact**: Saves 2–3 hours/week, prevents lost income
- **Tech Maturity**: Clean architecture, production-ready practices
- **Privacy-First**: PII sanitization, mock mode for demos

## Timing Notes

- Keep transitions smooth (2–3 seconds between sections)
- Focus on showing, not just telling
- Highlight conflict detection and AI planning as differentiators
- End with clear value proposition
